# Clickaway hook demo - React + TypeScript + Vite

Small demo to demonstrate the click away hook. 

If you just need the hook feel free to grab it from [/src/hooks](https://github.com/astonehall/easy-clickaway/blob/main/src/hooks/useClickAway.ts)

To use it in a component simply initialise and pass your function you wish to trigger.

```
  const ref = useClickAway(() => {
    // Your code here
  })
```

## How to run 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astonehall/easy-clickaway.git
cd easy-clickaway
npm install
npm run dev
```
